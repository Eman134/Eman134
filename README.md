## Hey 👋, I'm Kayke!

My name is Kayke Emanoel. I am a mechanical technician graduated from CEFET-MG and currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at PUC. Since 2018, I have been developing programming skills with a strong interest in various technologies. Over this time, I have completed academic and personal projects that have strengthened my expertise in backend development and software architecture.

I began my professional career in structural project design, which provided me with a solid foundation in technical reasoning, organization, and attention to detail—especially using tools like AutoCAD, Excel, and Word. Although I still work in mechanical engineering, I am in the process of transitioning to the technology field.

Currently, I am deepening my technical knowledge through my Software Engineering studies and seeking to move into the IT job market, aiming to contribute innovative and impactful solutions. I focus on languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Golang, as well as databases like PostgreSQL and tools like Docker. I have a strong interest in building modular systems, clean code, and software engineering best practices, and I am committed to continuous growth and meaningful contributions to projects and teams in the technology sector.
